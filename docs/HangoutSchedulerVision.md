# Hangout Scheduler

## Overview
Hangout Scheduler is an app designed to make hangout out with friends easier. One user can create a hangout with some basic information, while everyone invited can provide their availability. The creator of a hangout can then use everyones availability to finalize a date and time and make it visible to everyone invited.

## Creating a Hangout
To create a hangout, a user will provide a name and location as well as an optional description. Next, the user can specify if a date and time have already been set or if they still need to do so. If a date and time have not been set, the user can set a date range for each guest to provide their availability. Once they are done, the hangout is created a the user will be given a code that can be used to invite others to the hangout.

## Viewing & Modifying Hangouts

#### Viewing Hangouts
Hangouts a user had created will be visible on a distinct list to help make them easier to track and manage. This list will first show upcoming hangouts followed by past hangouts. Each group will have hangouts closest to the current date at the top of the list followed by hangouts further away.

#### Modifying Hangouts
Users have the ability to modify an upcoming hangouts they've created. This includes changing the name, location, and description of a hangout. If a date and time has been set for a hangout this can also be changed.

For hangouts where a date and time were not intially set, users will be able to view the availability provided by each guest in a grid format. The shade of the grid will vary to represent how many people are available at a given time. Once a date and time have been set, either when the hangout is first created or later on, the information will be visible to each guest.

After a guest has joined a hangout, the hangouts creator will have the option to remove a guest. Removing a guest will lead to the hangout being removed from a user's list of hangouts they were invited to.

### Hangouts a UserHas Been Invited To

When viewing a hangout a user will see the hangouts name, location, description (if applicable), date and time (if one has been set), and the list of users that have joined the hangout. For the list of guests, users will also be able to see if a guest has indicated they will be unavailable or they have provided availability. Each guest's availability will only be visible to that guest and the creator of the hangout. Users will also see the creator of the hangout. 

Listed hangouts will first show upcoming hangouts followed by past hangouts. Each group will have hangouts closest to the current date at the top of the list followed by hangouts further away. The list will also be color coded by hangouts a user has indicated they are unable to attend vs hangouts they've provided availability for.
